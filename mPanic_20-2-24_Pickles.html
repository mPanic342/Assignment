I also love watching and playing tennis; my favourite player is Novak Djokovic. I am big into technology as well; I enjoy gaming, and watching technology videos such as from the divine himself--Linus Tech Tips.

        <p>
            I do not see myself in the tech industry, as currently, it is very volitile and unstable. I moreso feel myself in the realm of engineering such as Aerospace or Electrical.
