            <h2>Me: Interests</h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Pickles, that's what I love. I also love skiing and try to spend as much time out west in the Canadian Rockies as possible (sadly, only 10 days a year, but I make it work). I also love watching and playing tennis; my favourite player is Novak Djokovic. I am big into technology as well; I enjoy gaming and watching technology videos such as those from the divine himselfâ€”Linus Tech Tips.</p>

            <h3>Me: Career</h3>
        </header>
        <p>I do not see myself in the tech industry, as currently, it is very volatile and unstable. I feel more suited to the realm of engineering such as Aerospace or Electrical.</p>
